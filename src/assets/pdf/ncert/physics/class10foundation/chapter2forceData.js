      title: "Introduction to Force",
      content: `Force is a fundamental concept in physics that governs the motion of objects around us. When we push a door, kick a ball, or lift a book, we are applying force.


What is Force?
- Force is a push or pull acting on an object
- It can change the state of motion of an object
- It can change the shape and size of an object
- Force has both magnitude and direction (vector quantity)
- SI unit: Newton (N)


Effects of Force:
• Can make a stationary object move
• Can stop a moving object
• Can change the speed of a moving object
• Can change the direction of motion
• Can change the shape and size of objects


Examples of Force in Daily Life:
• Pushing a cart in a supermarket
• Pulling a rope in tug of war
• Kicking a football
• Lifting weights
• Magnetic force attracting iron objects
• Gravitational force keeping us on Earth`,

      title: "Types of Forces",
      content: `Forces can be classified in different ways:


Based on Contact:


1. Contact Forces:
   - Forces that act when objects are in direct contact
   
   Types of Contact Forces:
   • Muscular Force: Force exerted by muscles
   • Friction Force: Opposes relative motion
   • Normal Force: Perpendicular to surface
   • Tension Force: Force in a stretched rope/string
   • Spring Force: Force exerted by compressed/stretched spring


2. Non-Contact Forces (Action at a Distance):
   - Forces that act without direct contact
   
   Types of Non-Contact Forces:
   • Gravitational Force: Attraction between masses
   • Magnetic Force: Force between magnets
   • Electrostatic Force: Force between charges


Based on Nature:


1. Balanced Forces:
   - Forces that cancel each other out
   - Net force = 0
   - No change in motion


2. Unbalanced Forces:
   - Forces that do not cancel out
   - Net force ≠ 0
   - Cause change in motion`,

      title: "Newton's First Law of Motion",
      content: `Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):

"An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."


Key Points:
• Also known as the Law of Inertia
• States the natural tendency of objects to resist change in motion
• Applies when net force on object is zero


Inertia:
- The tendency of an object to resist change in its state of motion
- Greater the mass, greater the inertia
- Types of Inertia:


1. Inertia of Rest:
   - Tendency to remain at rest
   - Example: Passengers jerk backward when bus starts


2. Inertia of Motion:
   - Tendency to remain in motion
   - Example: Passengers jerk forward when bus stops


3. Inertia of Direction:
   - Tendency to move in straight line
   - Example: Passengers slide sideways when bus turns


Real-life Examples:
• Seat belts in cars prevent passengers from continuing forward motion during sudden stops
• Dust falls off when carpet is beaten
• Coin falls into glass when cardboard is flicked away quickly`,

      title: "Newton's Second Law of Motion",
      content: `Newton's Second Law of Motion:

"The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass."


Mathematical Form:
F = ma

Where:
F = Net force (Newton)
m = Mass of object (kg)
a = Acceleration (m/s²)


Important Points:
• Force and acceleration are in the same direction
• If force increases, acceleration increases (for same mass)
• If mass increases, acceleration decreases (for same force)
• This law gives the measure of force


Alternative Forms:
• a = F/m
• m = F/a


Units:
• 1 Newton = 1 kg × 1 m/s²
• 1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s²


Applications:
• Rocket propulsion
• Car acceleration
• Sports (throwing, jumping)
• Design of vehicles and safety equipment


Key Insight:
Force is not needed to maintain motion (First Law), but force is needed to change motion (Second Law).`,

      title: "Newton's Third Law of Motion",
      content: `Newton's Third Law of Motion:

"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."


Key Features:
• Action and reaction forces are equal in magnitude
• They act in opposite directions
• They act on different objects
• They occur simultaneously
• Cannot cancel each other (act on different objects)


Mathematical Form:
If object A exerts force F₁₂ on object B,
then object B exerts force F₂₁ on object A
where F₁₂ = -F₂₁


Examples of Action-Reaction Pairs:


1. Walking:
   - Action: Foot pushes ground backward
   - Reaction: Ground pushes foot forward


2. Swimming:
   - Action: Swimmer pushes water backward
   - Reaction: Water pushes swimmer forward


3. Rocket Propulsion:
   - Action: Rocket pushes hot gases downward
   - Reaction: Hot gases push rocket upward


4. Firing a Gun:
   - Action: Gun pushes bullet forward
   - Reaction: Bullet pushes gun backward (recoil)


5. Jumping:
   - Action: Person pushes ground downward
   - Reaction: Ground pushes person upward


Important Note:
Action-reaction forces don't cancel because they act on different objects.`,

      title: "Mass and Weight",
      content: `Mass and Weight are often confused but are fundamentally different:


Mass:
- Amount of matter in an object
- Scalar quantity
- Remains constant everywhere
- Measured using beam balance
- SI unit: kilogram (kg)
- Does not depend on gravity


Weight:
- Force with which Earth attracts an object
- Vector quantity (acts toward Earth's center)
- Changes with location (gravity changes)
- Measured using spring balance
- SI unit: Newton (N)
- Depends on gravity


Relationship:
Weight = Mass × Gravitational acceleration
W = mg

Where:
W = Weight (N)
m = Mass (kg)
g = Acceleration due to gravity (≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth)

      title: "Momentum",
      content: `Momentum:
The quantity of motion possessed by a moving object.


Definition:
Momentum = Mass × Velocity
p = mv

Where:
p = Momentum (kg⋅m/s)
m = Mass (kg)
v = Velocity (m/s)


Characteristics:
• Vector quantity (same direction as velocity)
• SI unit: kg⋅m/s or N⋅s
• Depends on both mass and velocity
• Greater for heavier and faster objects


Examples:
• A truck moving slowly has more momentum than a car moving at same speed
• A bullet has high momentum due to high velocity despite small mass
• A cricket ball has more momentum than tennis ball at same speed


Conservation of Momentum:
"In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant."


Applications:
• Collision analysis
• Rocket propulsion  
• Recoil of guns
• Sports (impact analysis)


Relationship with Force:
From Newton's Second Law:
F = ma = m(v-u)/t = (mv-mu)/t
F = (p₂-p₁)/t = Δp/Δt

Therefore: Force = Rate of change of momentum`,

      title: "Impulse and Impulse-Momentum Theorem",
      content: `Impulse:
The change in momentum produced by a force.


Definition:
Impulse = Force × Time = Change in Momentum
J = F⋅t = Δp = p₂ - p₁


Where:
J = Impulse (N⋅s)
F = Force (N)
t = Time (s)
Δp = Change in momentum (kg⋅m/s)


Characteristics:
• Vector quantity
• SI unit: N⋅s (same as momentum unit kg⋅m/s)
• Greater impulse produces greater change in momentum


Impulse-Momentum Theorem:
"The impulse applied to an object equals the change in its momentum."

J = Δp = m(v₂ - v₁)


Applications in Daily Life:


1. Catching a Ball:
   - Extend hands to increase time
   - Reduces force on hands
   - Same impulse, less force due to more time


2. Car Safety Features:
   - Airbags increase collision time
   - Crumple zones increase collision time
   - Reduces force on passengers


3. Sports:
   - Follow through in cricket/tennis increases contact time
   - Increases impulse and ball speed


4. Jumping from Height:
   - Bend knees upon landing
   - Increases landing time, reduces impact force`,

      title: "Conservation of Momentum",
      content: `Law of Conservation of Momentum:

"In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system of objects remains constant."


Mathematical Statement:
For a system of objects:
Total initial momentum = Total final momentum
p₁ᵢ + p₂ᵢ + ... = p₁f + p₂f + ...


For Two Objects:
m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂

Where:
m₁, m₂ = masses of objects 1 and 2
u₁, u₂ = initial velocities
v₁, v₂ = final velocities


Conditions for Conservation:
• No external force acts on the system
• System is isolated
• Internal forces may act (like collision forces)


Types of Collisions:


1. Elastic Collision:
   - Kinetic energy is conserved
   - Objects separate after collision
   - Example: Collision of gas molecules


2. Inelastic Collision:
   - Kinetic energy is not conserved
   - Objects may stick together
   - Example: Car crashes


3. Perfectly Inelastic Collision:
   - Objects stick together after collision
   - Maximum kinetic energy is lost
   - Combined velocity: v = (m₁u₁ + m₂u₂)/(m₁ + m₂)


Real-world Examples:
• Recoil of gun when bullet is fired
• Rocket propulsion in space
• Pool/billiard ball collisions`,

      title: "Friction",
      content: `Friction:
The force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact.


Characteristics:
• Always opposes motion
• Acts parallel to the contact surface
• Depends on nature of surfaces
• Independent of area of contact
• Proportional to normal force


Types of Friction:


1. Static Friction (fs):
   - Acts when object is at rest
   - Prevents motion from starting
   - fs ≤ μsN (maximum static friction)
   - Example: Book on inclined plane not sliding


2. Kinetic Friction (fk):
   - Acts when object is moving
   - Opposes ongoing motion
   - fk = μkN (constant for given surfaces)
   - Example: Sliding book on table


3. Rolling Friction:
   - Acts when object rolls
   - Much smaller than sliding friction
   - Example: Wheel rolling on road


Mathematical Relations:
• Maximum Static Friction: fs,max = μsN
• Kinetic Friction: fk = μkN
• Normal Force: N = mg (on horizontal surface)

Where:
μs = coefficient of static friction
μk = coefficient of kinetic friction
N = normal force


Key Points:
• μs > μk (static friction > kinetic friction)
• Rolling friction < kinetic friction < static friction`,

      title: "Solved Examples - Part 1",
      content: `Example 1: Newton's Second Law
Problem: A force of 20 N acts on an object of mass 4 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced.


Solution:
Given: F = 20 N, m = 4 kg
Using F = ma
a = F/m = 20/4 = 5 m/s²

Answer: Acceleration = 5 m/s²

Solution:
Given: m = 50 kg

Weight on Earth:
W = mg = 50 × 9.8 = 490 N

Weight on Moon:
W = mg = 50 × 1.6 = 80 N

Answer: Weight on Earth = 490 N, Weight on Moon = 80 N

Final momentum: p₂ = mv = 0.5 × (-8) = -4 kg⋅m/s

Change in momentum: Δp = p₂ - p₁ = -4 - 5 = -9 kg⋅m/s

Problem: A 2 kg object moving at 6 m/s collides with a 3 kg object at rest. After collision, they move together. Find their common velocity.


Solution:
Given: m₁ = 2 kg, u₁ = 6 m/s, m₂ = 3 kg, u₂ = 0 m/s

This is perfectly inelastic collision (objects stick together).

Using conservation of momentum:
m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = (m₁ + m₂)v

Problem: A cricket ball of mass 0.15 kg moving at 20 m/s is hit by a bat and rebounds at 25 m/s. If contact time is 0.01 s, find the force exerted by bat.


Solution:
Given: m = 0.15 kg, u = 20 m/s, v = -25 m/s, t = 0.01 s

Change in momentum:
Δp = m(v - u) = 0.15(-25 - 20) = 0.15(-45) = -6.75 kg⋅m/s

Using impulse-momentum theorem:
F⋅t = Δp
F = Δp/t = -6.75/0.01 = -675 N

Answer: Force = 675 N (magnitude, opposite to initial direction)
