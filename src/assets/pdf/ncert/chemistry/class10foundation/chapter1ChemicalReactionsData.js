      content: `Chemical reactions are processes where one or more substances (reactants) are converted into new substances (products) with different properties.


What is a Chemical Reaction?
- A process in which one or more substances change to form new substances
- Involves breaking and forming of chemical bonds
- Results in new substances with different properties
- Cannot be easily reversed by physical means


Signs of Chemical Reaction:
• Change in color
• Evolution of gas (bubbling or fizzing)
• Formation of precipitate (solid formation)
• Change in temperature (heat absorbed or released)
• Change in smell
• Change in state (solid to liquid, etc.)


Examples of Chemical Reactions:
• Burning of magnesium: Mg + O₂ → MgO (bright white light)
• Rusting of iron: Fe + O₂ + H₂O → Fe₂O₃.xH₂O (brown color)
• Digestion of food in our body
• Photosynthesis in plants
• Respiration in living organisms


Types Based on Energy Change:
• Exothermic reactions: Release energy (heat/light)
• Endothermic reactions: Absorb energy from surroundings


Important Points:
• Mass is conserved in chemical reactions
• Atoms are neither created nor destroyed
• Only rearrangement of atoms takes place`,

      title: "Chemical Equations",
      content: `Chemical Equation:
A symbolic representation of a chemical reaction using chemical formulas and symbols.


Components of Chemical Equation:
• Reactants: Starting substances (left side)
• Products: New substances formed (right side)
• Arrow (→): Shows direction of reaction
• Plus sign (+): Separates multiple reactants or products


Word Equation vs Chemical Equation:


Word Equation:
Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide


Chemical Equation:
Mg + O₂ → MgO


Skeleton Equation:
The unbalanced chemical equation showing only the formulas.


Balanced Chemical Equation:
A chemical equation where the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides.


Rules for Writing Chemical Equations:
1. Write correct formulas of reactants and products
2. Use appropriate symbols and formulas
3. Balance the equation (equal atoms on both sides)
4. Use proper physical states: (s), (l), (g), (aq)
5. Show conditions like temperature, pressure, catalyst


Example:
Unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O
Balanced: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O


Symbols Used:
• (s) = solid state
• (l) = liquid state  
• (g) = gaseous state
• (aq) = aqueous solution
• ↑ = gas evolved
• ↓ = precipitate formed
• Δ = heat supplied`,

      title: "Balancing Chemical Equations",
      content: `Balancing Chemical Equations:
The process of making the number of atoms of each element equal on both sides of a chemical equation.


Law of Conservation of Mass:
"Matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction."
- Proposed by Antoine Lavoisier
- Total mass of reactants = Total mass of products
- Atoms are conserved, not molecules


Steps to Balance Chemical Equations:


Step 1: Write the skeleton equation
Example: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃


Step 2: Count atoms of each element on both sides
Left side: Fe = 1, O = 2
Right side: Fe = 2, O = 3


Step 3: Balance one element at a time
Start with the most complex molecule
Balance Fe: 2Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃


Step 4: Balance remaining elements
Balance O: 2Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃
But this makes Fe unbalanced again


Step 5: Use appropriate coefficients
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃


Step 6: Verify the balance
Left side: Fe = 4, O = 6
Right side: Fe = 4, O = 6 ✓


Tips for Balancing:
• Never change the chemical formulas
• Use only coefficients (numbers before formulas)
• Start with the most complex compound
• Balance metals first, then non-metals, then hydrogen and oxygen
• Use fractions if necessary, then multiply to get whole numbers
• Check your final answer


Common Mistakes:
• Changing subscripts instead of coefficients
• Not checking if all elements are balanced
• Starting with hydrogen or oxygen first`,

      title: "Types of Chemical Reactions - Part 1",
      content: `Chemical reactions can be classified into different types based on the nature of the reaction:


1. Combination Reactions (Synthesis):
Two or more reactants combine to form a single product.
General form: A + B → AB


Examples:
• 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO
• C + O₂ → CO₂
• CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂
• N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃


Characteristics:
• Multiple reactants, single product
• Usually exothermic (release energy)
• Formation of compounds from elements


2. Decomposition Reactions:
A single reactant breaks down into two or more products.
General form: AB → A + B


Types of Decomposition:


a) Thermal Decomposition (heat required):
• 2HgO → 2Hg + O₂ (heating)
• CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (heating)
• 2Pb(NO₃)₂ → 2PbO + 4NO₂ + O₂


b) Electrolytic Decomposition (electricity required):
• 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂ (electrolysis)
• 2NaCl → 2Na + Cl₂ (electrolysis)


c) Photolytic Decomposition (light required):
• 2AgBr → 2Ag + Br₂ (sunlight)
• 2AgCl → 2Ag + Cl₂ (sunlight)


Characteristics:
• Single reactant, multiple products
• Usually endothermic (require energy)
• Breaking of compounds into simpler substances


Applications:

      title: "Types of Chemical Reactions - Part 2",
      content: `3. Displacement Reactions (Single Replacement):
A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.
General form: A + BC → AC + B


Examples:
• Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu
• Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu
• Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂


Reactivity Series (decreasing order):
K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Pb > H > Cu > Hg > Ag > Au

• More reactive metals can displace less reactive ones
• Metals above hydrogen can displace hydrogen from acids


4. Double Displacement Reactions:
Two compounds exchange their ions to form two new compounds.
General form: AB + CD → AD + CB


Examples:
• AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃
• BaCl₂ + Na₂SO₄ → BaSO₄↓ + 2NaCl
• HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O


Types:
a) Precipitation Reactions:
• Form insoluble products (precipitates)
• AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃

b) Neutralization Reactions:
• Acid + Base → Salt + Water
• HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O


Characteristics:
• Exchange of ions between compounds
• No change in oxidation states
• Often involve formation of precipitate or water


Conditions for Double Displacement:
• One product should be insoluble (precipitate)
• Or one product should be a gas
• Or formation of water (neutralization)`,

      title: "Oxidation and Reduction",
      content: `Oxidation and Reduction (Redox Reactions):
Reactions involving transfer of electrons or change in oxidation states.


Traditional Definitions:
• Oxidation: Addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen
• Reduction: Removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen


Modern Definitions:
• Oxidation: Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number)
• Reduction: Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number)


Examples:


1. In terms of Oxygen:
   CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O
   • CuO is reduced (oxygen removed)
   • H₂ is oxidized (oxygen added)


2. In terms of Hydrogen:
   H₂S + Cl₂ → 2HCl + S
   • H₂S is oxidized (hydrogen removed)
   • Cl₂ is reduced (hydrogen added)


3. In terms of Electrons:
   Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu
   • Zn loses electrons (oxidized): Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
   • Cu²⁺ gains electrons (reduced): Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu


Key Terms:
• Oxidizing Agent (Oxidant): Causes oxidation, gets reduced itself
• Reducing Agent (Reductant): Causes reduction, gets oxidized itself


In the reaction: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu
• Zn is reducing agent (gets oxidized)
• CuSO₄ is oxidizing agent (gets reduced)


Oxidation Numbers (States):
Rules for assigning oxidation numbers:
1. Free elements have oxidation number = 0
2. Oxidation number of ion = its charge
3. Hydrogen = +1 (except in metal hydrides = -1)
4. Oxygen = -2 (except in peroxides = -1)
5. Sum of oxidation numbers in compound = 0
6. Sum in polyatomic ion = charge on ion


Applications:
• Rusting of iron (oxidation)
• Combustion reactions
• Respiration (glucose oxidation)
• Photosynthesis (CO₂ reduction)`,

• Further oxidizes to: 2Fe(OH)₃ → Fe₂O₃.3H₂O (rust)


Conditions for Rusting:
• Presence of oxygen
• Presence of water/moisture
• Both are essential for rusting


Prevention of Rusting:
• Galvanization (coating with zinc)
• Painting (prevents contact with air and moisture)
• Oiling and greasing
• Alloying (stainless steel contains chromium)


2. Rancidity:
Oxidation of fats and oils in food leading to bad taste and smell.


Causes:
• Reaction with oxygen in air
• Breakdown of fats into smaller molecules
• Produces aldehydes and ketones (bad smell)


Prevention of Rancidity:
• Antioxidants (BHA, BHT, Vitamin E)
• Vacuum packaging (remove air)
• Refrigeration (slow down reaction)
• Nitrogen packaging (inert atmosphere)


3. Beneficial Oxidation:
• Combustion for energy production
• Respiration in living organisms
• Cooking and food preparation
• Industrial processes


Examples in Food Industry:
• Browning of apples (phenol oxidation)
• Rancidity in oils and butter
• Wine and cheese aging (controlled oxidation)


Protection Methods:
• Use of antioxidants in food
• Proper packaging techniques
• Storage in cool, dry places
